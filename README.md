# 🗂️ PDF Stock Manager

## 💡 The Concept

A lightweight and innovative solution to manage stock using JavaScript inside a PDF file. Designed originally for a legacy system running Adobe Reader XI on Windows XP, this project showcases how PDFs can be transformed into interactive tools for dynamic inventory management.

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the PDF Stock Manager! This editable PDF leverages JavaScript to provide dynamic calculations and interactivity. While originally created to meet specific stock management needs in a manufacturing context, this concept can be adapted for various use cases, such as tracking inventory, managing orders, or creating custom reports.
The PDF features three tables:
- Received Materials: For adding materials received.
- Used Materials: For logging materials used or removed.
- Material Totals: Automatically updated totals based on the other two tables.
