![Project Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coelhof12/PDF-Stock-Manager/refs/heads/main/Assets/Repo_Covers.jpg)

## 💡 The Concept

A lightweight and innovative solution to manage stock using JavaScript inside a PDF file. Originally designed for a legacy system running Adobe Reader XI on Windows XP, this project demonstrates how PDFs can be transformed into interactive tools for dynamic inventory management.

This concept emerged from the need to maintain up-to-date stock levels on a computer that could not support any new software installations. It was initially tailored for tracking specific materials used in a particular stage of the production line within a factory.

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the PDF Stock Manager! This editable PDF leverages JavaScript to provide dynamic calculations and interactivity. While originally created to meet specific stock management needs in a manufacturing context, this concept can be adapted for various use cases, such as tracking inventory, managing orders, or creating custom reports.
The PDF features three tables:
- Received Materials: For adding materials received.
- Used Materials: For logging materials used or removed.
- Material Totals: Automatically updated totals based on the other two tables.

## 📊 Key Features

- Interactive Fields: Automatically update totals based on entries in the "Received" and "Used" tables.
- Customizable Design: Easily adapt the fields and calculations to fit your specific use case.
- Lightweight Solution: No additional software or plugins required—works directly in Adobe Reader.
- Portable and Compatible: Designed to work on older systems and with minimal resources.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Received Materials: Enter the materials received along with the quantity and date.
- Used Materials: Log the materials removed or used.
- Material Totals: Automatically calculates the total stock available.

## 🌟 Use Cases

- Inventory management in small businesses.
- Order tracking in legacy systems.
- Simple project tracking and reporting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
