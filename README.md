## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the PDF Stock Manager! This editable PDF leverages JavaScript to provide dynamic calculations and interactivity. While originally created to meet specific stock management needs in a manufacturing context, this concept can be adapted for various use cases, such as tracking inventory, managing orders, or creating custom reports.
The PDF features three tables:
- Received Materials: For adding materials received.
- Used Materials: For logging materials used or removed.
- Material Totals: Automatically updated totals based on the other two tables.

## 📊 Key Features

- Interactive Fields: Automatically update totals based on entries in the "Received" and "Used" tables.
- Customizable Design: Easily adapt the fields and calculations to fit your specific use case.
- Lightweight Solution: No additional software or plugins required—works directly in Adobe Reader.
- Portable and Compatible: Designed to work on older systems and with minimal resources.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Received Materials: Enter the materials received along with the quantity and date.
- Used Materials: Log the materials removed or used.
- Material Totals: Automatically calculates the total stock available.

## 🌟 Use Cases

This project can be repurposed for:
- Inventory management in small businesses.
- Order tracking in legacy systems.
- Simple project tracking and reporting.
